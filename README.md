# MxU Slides

A native macOS presentation app for churches: lyrics, slides, media, timers, stage displays, NDI and DeckLink output, and live streaming. Everything runs on this Mac: no account, no server.

MxU Slides is source-available under the PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

What the license allows:

- [x] Use it for any purpose, including commercially and in production, at a church, a venue, or a business
- [x] Read, modify, and build on the source
- [x] Fork it and distribute copies or modified versions, as long as the license and its notice travel with them
- [x] Contribute changes back

What it does not allow:

- [ ] Providing a product that competes with MxU Slides, or with any product MxU provides using it, even if that product is free, uses a different interface or platform, or is written in another language
- [ ] Removing or altering the license text or the required notice

The full terms, including what happens if MxU later ships a product that competes with yours, are in [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).

## Windows

A Windows build lives in `apps/windows`: the same library, documents, show
state, scene builder and Local API, with a host that serves the app's user
interface and an output window. See [apps/windows/README.md](apps/windows/README.md)
for the toolchain, how to build and run, and what is not on Windows yet.

## Getting started

Requirements:

- macOS 14 or newer, Xcode 26 (Swift 6 toolchain)
- [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen): `brew install xcodegen`
- Node 24 (`.tool-versions`) for the schema codegen and the drive scripts
- Optional, for NDI inputs and outputs: install the [NDI SDK for Apple](https://ndi.video/for-developers/ndi-sdk/) at `/Library/NDI SDK for Apple`. Without it `NDIKit` builds a stub and NDI is unavailable in the app. After installing or removing the SDK, delete `~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/manifests` and use Product › Clean Build Folder. `apps/mac/scripts/release-dmg.sh` still requires it.
- Optional, for ProPresenter import: `brew install protobuf swift-protobuf`, then run `apps/mac/scripts/generate-propresenter-proto.sh`. Without the generated types `ProImport` builds a stub and the import menu reports that it is unavailable. `apps/mac/scripts/release-dmg.sh` still requires them.

The Blackmagic DeckLink SDK headers are vendored, so DeckLink output needs no install to build.

Build and run:

```bash
cd apps/mac
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project MxUSlides.xcodeproj -scheme MxUSlides -configuration Debug -disableAutomaticPackageResolution -onlyUsePackageVersionsFromResolvedFile build
open "$(xcodebuild -project MxUSlides.xcodeproj -scheme MxUSlides -configuration Debug -disableAutomaticPackageResolution -onlyUsePackageVersionsFromResolvedFile -showBuildSettings 2>/dev/null | awk '/TARGET_BUILD_DIR/{print $3; exit}')/MxU Slides.app"
```

Or open `MxUSlides.xcodeproj` in Xcode after `xcodegen generate` and run the `MxUSlides` scheme. Re-run `xcodegen generate` whenever you add or remove source files; the project file is generated and not checked in.

Dependency versions are pinned in the checked-in `Package.resolved` files for `LocalAPI`, `StreamEngine`, and `ProImport`. XcodeGen combines those pins into the app's generated lockfile, including SwiftProtobuf only when the ProPresenter sources are present. Re-run `xcodegen generate` after generating or removing those sources; when switching configurations, also clear SwiftPM's manifest cache as described above and clean the build. Every app build verifies the generated lock against the package pins, and the commands above and the release script disable automatic dependency updates. For an intentional dependency update, update the affected package's lockfile, regenerate the project, and test both the package and app.

## Building and testing

Each package builds and tests on its own with SwiftPM. None of them needs the NDI SDK (`NDIKit` builds a stub without it):

```bash
cd apps/mac/Packages
swift test --package-path PresenterCore
swift test --package-path SlideScene
swift test --package-path RenderEngine
swift test --package-path OutputEngine
swift test --package-path LocalAPI --force-resolved-versions
swift test --package-path ProImport --force-resolved-versions --manifest-cache none --disable-build-manifest-caching
```

Run `node apps/mac/scripts/test-dependency-locking.mjs` from the repository root to check lock generation and rejection of missing, conflicting, or changed pins.

Debug builds are ad-hoc signed (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY: "-"` in `apps/mac/project.yml`), so a fresh clone builds and runs without an Apple developer account. Set `bundleIdPrefix`, `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`, and a signing identity there before archiving or distributing.

### Document schema

Edit `packages/schema/documents.json`, then regenerate:

```bash
node packages/schema/codegen.mjs
```

That rewrites `PresenterCore/Sources/PresenterCore/Generated/Models.swift` and `LocalAPI/Sources/LocalAPI/Resources/document-schemas.json`. Fields added after a type ships must be optional so existing libraries keep decoding.

### Release build

`apps/mac/scripts/release-dmg.sh` builds, Developer ID-signs, notarizes, and staples a DMG. It expects a `notarization-profile` entry in your Keychain (`xcrun notarytool store-credentials`), the NDI SDK's redistributable license file, and the ProPresenter types from `apps/mac/scripts/generate-propresenter-proto.sh`.

### Local API

With Settings › Local API enabled, the app serves a REST and WebSocket API on port 6980, authenticated by scoped bearer tokens created in the same pane. `GET /v1/status` returns the live slide; `scripts/*.mjs` show it driving a show. The route table and OpenAPI document live in `apps/mac/Packages/LocalAPI`.

### Perf and diagnostics scripts

- `apps/mac/scripts/perf/run.sh` runs the scripted editor and animation perf check against a staged build and compares with `baseline.json`.
- `apps/mac/scripts/hitch-report.py` summarizes the main-thread hitches recorded in the app's breadcrumb logs (Help › Report a Problem saves them as a zip).
- `apps/mac/scripts/hls-sink.mjs` / `hls-replay.mjs` stand in for an HLS ingest endpoint when testing streaming.
